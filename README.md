# ArenaLive-Classic
ArenaLive for Classic (Patch 1.15)

No guarantee it will work on older patches.
This was run and tested on SoD in 2024. I found these old files and didn't want them going to waste.

If you're trying to make this work in any other version of WoW, I highly recommend updating the libraries first. They're probably outdated.
